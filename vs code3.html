    <h3><u>About Visual Code:</u></h3>
    <p>Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as VS Code,[9] is a code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers.[10][11] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded version control with Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.</p>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is proprietary software released under the "Microsoft Software License",[6] but based on the MIT licensed program named "Visual Studio Code — Open Source" (also known as "Code — OSS"), also created by Microsoft and available through GitHub.[12]</p>
    <p>In the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool among 86,544 respondents, with 73.71% reporting that they use it.[13]</p>

        <dt><h3><u>Key Features Of VS Code:</u></h3></dt>
        <dd><b>1.Command Line:</b>Visual Studio Code has a powerful command line interface that lets you control how you launch the editor. You can open different files, install extensions, and even change the display language at the startup.</dd>
        <dd><b>2.Command Palette:</b>VS Code is equally accessible from the keyboard. The most important key combination to know is Ctrl+Shift+P, which brings up the Command Palette. From here, you would have access to all of the functionality of VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations.</dd>
        <dd><b>3.Git Integration:</b>Visual Studio Code comes with Git integration that allows you to commit, pull, and push your code changes to a remote Git repository.</dd>
        <dd><b>4.Change language mode:</b>If you want to persist the new language mode for that file type, you can use the Configure File Association for command to associate the current file extension with an installed language.</dd>
        <dd><b>5.Zen Mode:</b>Zen Mode lets you focus on your code by hiding all UI except the editor (no Activity Bar, Status Bar, Side Bar and Panel), going to full screen and centering the editor layout. Zen mode can be toggled using the View menu, Command Palette, or by the shortcut Ctrl+K Z. Double Esc exits Zen Mode.</dd>
        <dd><b>6.Split view:</b>If you’re good at multitasking and if you are working on two different files of the same project simultaneously, or need to check the difference between two files then go to the split view.</dd>
        <dd><b>7.Status Bar:</b>Users can see Errors and warnings from here.Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+M</dd>
        <dd><b>8.Debugging:</b>Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select Debug: Open launch.json, which will prompt you to select the environment that matches your project (Node.JS, Python, C++, etc). This will generate a launch.json file. Node.JS support is built-in and other environments require installing the appropriate language extensions. See the debugging documentation for more details.</dd>
        <dd><b>9.Default Keyboard shortcuts:</b>All of the commands are in the Command Palette with the associated key binding (if it exists). If you forget a keyboard shortcut, you can use the Command Palette to help yourself out. Download the keyboard shortcut reference sheet for your platform (macOS, Windows, and Linux).</dd>

    <h3><u>Extensions For VS Code:</u></h3>
    <p>VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code.</p>
